# Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes student performance data using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to identify patterns and key factors influencing student outcomes, such as study time, gender, health, or parental education level.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Load and explore student performance data
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Handle missing or inconsistent values
- Visualize relationships between variables
- Find insights to improve academic performance

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** â€“ For data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** â€“ For visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ For code execution and analysis



## ðŸ§ª Dataset Information

Typical columns in the dataset may include:
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Parental Education Level`
- `Study Time`
- `Health`
- `Absences`
- `Math Score`, `Reading Score`, `Writing Score`

> *Replace this section with your exact column names if different.*

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Includes

- Distribution of scores based on gender
- Correlation between study time and performance
- Visual comparison of scores across different variables
- Heatmap of feature correlation
